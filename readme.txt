SAN Boot Configuration Driver for Windows - Quick Start Instructions
====================================================================



1. If you are trying to SAN-boot Windows XP or Windows Server 2003, then
   download and install the Microsoft iSCSI Initiator (boot-capable version)
   using the instructions at

     http://etherboot.org/wiki/sanboot/winnt_iscsi

   (You do not need to do this if you are trying to boot Windows Vista,
   Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, or a newer version of Windows.)



2. If you are trying to SAN-boot over an Infiniband network, then download
   and install the Windows OpenFabrics package from

     http://www.openfabrics.org/downloads/WinOF

   (You do not need to do this if you are trying to boot over a standard
   Ethernet network.)



3. Run sanbootconf.msi from this directory.



Congratulations, your system is now SAN-bootable!
